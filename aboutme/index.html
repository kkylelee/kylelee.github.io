        <h1>Activities</h1>
        <p>I enjoy watching and playing basketball. As I'm 6'1", I play center position to take advantage of my height.
        <p>I listen to all genres of music, ranging from pop to country music.
        <p>I appreciate movies with hidden messages/confusing endings. The film that has primarily been on mind recently is <em>Enemy</em>.
        <p>I find board games to be an incredible way to pass time. My favorites include <em>Chess</em>, <em>Stratego</em>, and <em>Egyptian War</em>. 
        <p>I love trying out new activities! In fact, I've always wanted to make my own website and I finally got the opportunity to during winter break.
            
        <h1>Community Service</h1>
        <p>I help organize youth group activities, ranging from shoebox packaging to serving at homeless shelters.
        <p>I am the TA for my Church's weekly gatherings for children in middle school. 
        <p>I am the founder and director of the CMC contest, which is free to all students on the AoPS website.
