        <h1>Problem Collection</h1>
        <p>Listed below are some of my personal favorite problems created by me that have appeared on various math contests. They are sorted in roughly increasing difficulty. 
        <ul type = "square">
            <li> (CMC 10A 2018 #19/CMC 12A 2018 #16) Define \(f(n)\) to be the sum of the positive integer factors of \(n.\) If \(f(n)=360\) and \(f(3n)=1170,\) what is the smallest possible value of \(f(2n)?\)
            <li> (CIME I 2018 #3) Let \(a, b, c >1\) be positive real numbers such that \(a^{\log_b c}=27, b^{\log_c a}=81,\) and \(c^{\log_a b}=243.\) Then the value of \(\log_3{abc}\) can be written as \(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z}\) for positive integers \(x,y,\) and \(z.\) Find \(x+y+z.\)
            <li> (CIME I 2018 #6) Let \(\mathcal{P}\) be the set of all polynomials \(p(x)=x^4+2x^2+mx+n,\) where \(m\) and \(n\) range over the positive reals. There exists a unique \(p(x) \in \mathcal{P}\) such that \(p(x)\) has a real root, \(m\) is minimized, and \(p(1)=99.\) Find \(n.\) 
            <li> (CMC 10A 2018 #24) In \(\triangle ABC\), let the bisector of \(\angle BAC\) meet \(BC\) and the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABC\) at points \(D\) and  \(E\), respectively, and let \(F\) be the midpoint of \(BC\). If \([DEF]=1/3\), \(DF=1/2\), and \(BC=5\), what is the area of \(\triangle ABC?\)
            <li> (CIME I 2020 #8) A person has been declared the first to inhabit a certain planet on day \(N=0.\) For each positive integer \(N>0,\) if there is a positive number of people on the planet, then either one of the following three occurs, each with probability \(\frac13\):
        - the population stays the same;
        - the population increases by \(2^N\); or
        - the population decreases by \(2^{N-1}\). (If there are no greater than \(2^{N-1}\) people on the planet, the population drops to zero, and the process terminates.)
    The probability that at some point there are exactly \(2^{20}+2^{19}+2^{10}+2^9+1\) people on the planet can be written as \(\frac{p}{3^q},\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are positive integers such that \(p\) is not divisible by \(3.\) Find the remainder when \(p+q\) is divided by \(1000.\)    
            <li> (CMC 10A 2018 #25) A \(M \times N\) grid of unit squares is tiled with as many \(5 \times 1\) indistinguishable rectangles as possible, such that every tile lies strictly inside the grid and no tiles overlap, leaving exactly one \(1 \times 1\) unit square. If there are exactly \(100\) positions this square can occupy, what is the sum of all possible distinct values of \(M+N?\)
            <li> (CMC 12A 2018 #25) A group of \(5\) students sit around a circle. Each minute, each person points at another student and that person is thus removed from the circle. What is the expected number of minutes it will take until either a single person or nobody remains? (Note that two people could be pointing at the same person)
