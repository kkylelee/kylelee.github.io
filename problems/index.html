        <h1>Problem Collection</h1>
        <p>Listed below are some of my personal favorite problems I have created that have appeared on various math contests.
        <ul type = "square">
            <li> (CMC 12A 2018) A group of $5$ students sit around a circle. Each minute, each person points at another student and that person is thus removed from the circle. What is the expected number of minutes it will take until either a single person or nobody remains? (Note that two people could be pointing at the same person)
