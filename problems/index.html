        <h1>Problem Collection</h1>
        <p>Listed below are some of my personal favorite problems I have created that have appeared on various math contests. They are in roughly increasing difficulty. 
        <ul type = "square">
            <li> (CMC 10A 2018 #24) In \(\triangle ABC\), let the bisector of \(\angle BAC\) meet \(BC\) and the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABC\) at points \(D\) and  \(E\), respectively, and let \(F\) be the midpoint of \(BC\). If \([DEF]=1/3\), \(DF=1/2\), and \(BC=5\), what is the area of \(\triangle ABC\)?
            <li> (CMC 12A 2018 #25) A group of 5 students sit around a circle. Each minute, each person points at another student and that person is thus removed from the circle. What is the expected number of minutes it will take until either a single person or nobody remains? (Note that two people could be pointing at the same person)
            <li> \[2^{3x}=8\]
        </ul>
