        <h1>Problem Collection</h1>
        <p>Listed below are some of my personal favorite problems I have created that have appeared on various math contests.
        <ul type = "square">
            <li> (CMC 12A 2018 #25) A group of 5 students sit around a circle. Each minute, each person points at another student and that person is thus removed from the circle. What is the expected number of minutes it will take until either a single person or nobody remains? (Note that two people could be pointing at the same person)
            <li> <div class="latex">  
                    \int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{x^{4}\left(1-x\right)^{4}}{1+x^{2}}dx =\frac{22}{7}-\pi  
                 </div>
        </ul>
        </ul>
    </body>
