        <h1>Problem Collection</h1>
        <p>Listed below are some of my personal favorite problems created by me that have appeared on various math contests. They are sorted in roughly increasing difficulty. 
        <ul type = "square">
            <li> (CMC 10A 2018 #19/CMC 12A 2018 #16) Define \(f(n)\) to be the sum of the positive integer factors of \(n.\) If \(f(n)=360\) and \(f(3n)=1170,\) what is the smallest possible value of \(f(2n)?\)
            <li> (CIME I 2018 #3) Let \(a, b, c >1\) be positive real numbers such that \(a^{\log_b c}=27, b^{\log_c a}=81,\) and \(c^{\log_a b}=243.\) Then the value of \(\log_3{abc}\) can be written as \(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z}\) for positive integers \(x,y,\) and \(z.\) Find \(x+y+z.\)
            <li> (CMC 10A 2020 #21) Let acute \(\triangle ABC\) have circumradius of length \(10.\) Suppose \(D\) is the foot of the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\) such that \(BD=4\) and \(CD=8.\) The area of \(\triangle ABC\) can be written as \(a+b\sqrt{c}\) for positive integers \(a,b,c,\) where \(c\) is not divisible by the square of any prime. What is the value of \(a+b+c?\)
            <li> (CMC 10A 2020 #24/CMC 12A 2020 #21) How many ordered triples \((a,b,c)\) of not necessarily distinct positive integer divisors of \(216,000\) satisfy \(\text{lcm}(a,\gcd(b,c))=\text{lcm}(b,\gcd(a,c))=\text{lcm}(c,\gcd(a,b))?\)
            <li> (CIME I 2019 #3) The increasing sequence \[12, ~15, ~18, ~21, ~51, ~81, \ldots\] consists of all the positive multiples of \(3\) containing at least one digit that is a \(1.\) The number \(2019\) is the \(\text{N}^{\text{th}}\) term of this sequence, where \(\text{N}\) is a positive integer. Find \(\text{N}.\)
            <li> (CMC 10A 2020 #25/CMC 12A 2020 #24) Call a four-digit positive integer <em>asuboptimal</em> if the sum of two of its digits is equal to the sum of the other two digits. For instance, \(1234, 2020,\) and \(9801\) are all asuboptimal. How many four-digit positive integers are asuboptimal?
            <li> (CIME I 2018 #6) Let \(\mathcal{P}\) be the set of all polynomials \(p(x)=x^4+2x^2+mx+n,\) where \(m\) and \(n\) range over the positive reals. There exists a unique \(p(x) \in \mathcal{P}\) such that \(p(x)\) has a real root, \(m\) is minimized, and \(p(1)=99.\) Find \(n.\) 
            <li> (CMC 10A 2018 #24) In \(\triangle ABC\), let the bisector of \(\angle BAC\) meet \(BC\) and the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABC\) at points \(D\) and  \(E\), respectively, and let \(F\) be the midpoint of \(BC\). If \([DEF]=1/3\), \(DF=1/2\), and \(BC=5\), what is the area of \(\triangle ABC?\)
            <li> (CIME I 2020 #8) A person has been declared the first to inhabit a certain planet on day \(N=0.\) For each positive integer \(N>0,\) if there is a positive number of people on the planet, then either one of the following three occurs, each with probability \(\frac13\):
        <p> - the population stays the same; the population increases by \(2^N\); or the population decreases by \(2^{N-1}\). (If there are no greater than \(2^{N-1}\) people on the planet, the population drops to zero, and the process terminates.) </p>
    The probability that at some point there are exactly \(2^{20}+2^{19}+2^{10}+2^9+1\) people on the planet can be written as \(\frac{p}{3^q},\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are positive integers such that \(p\) is not divisible by \(3.\) Find the remainder when \(p+q\) is divided by \(1000.\)    
            <li> (CIME I 2021 #9) Let \(a,b,c,d\) be integers such that \(ab+cd=81 \quad\,\,\text{and}\quad\,\, ad+bc=80.\) Find the remainder when the sum of all distinct possible values of \(ac+bd\) is divided by \(1000.\)
            <li> (CIME II 2019 #7) In \(\triangle ABC, AB=5, AC=6,\) and \(BC=7.\) Let point \(O\) be the circumcenter of \(\triangle ABC\) and let the circumcircles of \(\triangle AOB\) and \(\triangle AOC\) intersect \(\overline{BC}\) again at \(D\) and \(E,\) respectively. Rays \(AD\) and \(AE\) meet the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABC\) again at \(P\) and \(Q,\) respectively. Then, \(PQ=\frac{m}{n},\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(m+n.\)
            <li> (CIME II 2019 #12) Max is playing a video game with \(99\) levels, labeled \(1,2,\dots,99.\) Whenever Max completes a level, he begins the next one immediately. However, for all \(1\leq n\leq 99,\) Max fails the \(n^{\text{th}}\) level with probability \((n+1)^{-2}.\) Whenever he fails a level, he quits for the day and attempts the level again the next day. If Max first attempts the first level on Day \(1\) and completes the \(99^{\text{th}}\) level on Day \(K,\) then the expected value of \(K\) can be expressed as \(\frac{p}{q},\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when \(p+q\) is divided by \(1000.\)
            <li> (CMC ARML 2019 #8) There exists unique positive integers \(1<a<b\) satisfying \(a^2+b^2=2^{20}+1.\) Compute \(a+b.\)
            <li> (CMC 10A 2018 #25) A \(M \times N\) grid of unit squares is tiled with as many \(5 \times 1\) indistinguishable rectangles as possible, such that every tile lies strictly inside the grid and no tiles overlap, leaving exactly one \(1 \times 1\) unit square. If there are exactly \(100\) positions this square can occupy, what is the sum of all possible distinct values of \(M+N?\)
            <li> (CMC 12A 2018 #25) A group of \(5\) students sit around a circle. Each minute, each person points at another student and that person is thus removed from the circle. What is the expected number of minutes it will take until either a single person or nobody remains? (Note that two people could be pointing at the same person)
